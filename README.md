# SubredditMirror

This is a simple reddit bot which will copy posts from one subreddit to another,
ideally used for copying posts to a private subreddit for bot development
purposes. It requires you to be a moderator of the subreddit you are copying
posts to, and allows you to choose, along with the source/destination subreddit:

* The sort method of the posts chosen (hot, new, controversial, and top)
* The time frame to grab posts from (day, week, month, year, all)
* How many posts to grab

```
